Features to add:

1. Currently max virtual-space size per hmalloc() is bounded by 36 bits (64GB).
Should support arbitrarily large allocation (up to 40 bits 1TB).

2. Max active hmalloc() instances is bounded by 8 bits. This means no more than
256 hmalloc() at any given time. Should relax this restriction.
