Hey James,  I can only run the scan test on a ocz ssd because the
nodes with fusionio cards are being used by other students at my lab.

For the scan test I allocated 500 k objects (32kB each) and 3
iterations. Total data amount is 16GB, hybrid-mem uses an internal RAM
cache = 32MB, so all accesses are to the SSD.

The scan test on OCZ gives following results:

hello hybrid-mem addr: 0x7fff45119a30
cumu-time(sec): 332.298074
per-iter time(sec): 110.766025
avg access latency(sec): 0.000222
access  throughput per sec: 4514.019537

Here the avg access latency is 0.2 ms,  access throughput is about 4.5k/sec.


The ocz drive I used is:
ATA      OCZ Z-DRIVE R4 C 2.15 PQ: 0 ANSI: 5
